# Receiver Function Scripts and other SAC Tools
A collection of bash scripts for downloading and processing SAC (Seismic Analysis Code) files, intended to speed up the pipeline for receiver function analysis via iterative time-domain deconvolution (iterdecon).

I am an undergraduate that wrote these scripts to help me with a project using receiver functions. I was tired of my inability to keep track of different versions and I figured this repository could be of use to both myself and other people in the future. Keep in mind, I am a seismologist and all my scripting knowledge is self-taught. If you think there's a better way to do this, I'm sure you're right! But sometimes I just want to work on some data and I don't want to get bogged down by writing the same script in a slightly better way for the 10th time.
