This script can automatically filter large amounts of seismic data using SAC commands.
It assumes the file structure of ScriptFolder/Events/seismicdata.sac where ScriptFolder is the directory from which you run this script.

This can perform several things:

Downsampling
Remove mean
Remove trend
Bandpass filter
