This script can automatically rotate large amounts of 3 component seismic data using SAC's rotate command.
It is assumed that the data is grouped by event and the script is run in the directory that contains the event directories.

The following fields are required to be defined for this to work:
CMPAZ - component azimuth
CMPINC - component inclination
STLA - station latitude
STLO - station longitude
EVLA - event latitude
EVLO - event longitude
